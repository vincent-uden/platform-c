# Platform C

This is a small 2D platforming prototype written in C99/ANSI-C based on SDL2. It
includes a playable environment and a map editor in the same binary.


## Building
The included Makefile should cover everything. "make" to compile and "make run"
to run the binary. SDL2 with all of it's library's (such as SDL_Image) are
needed to compile the project.
